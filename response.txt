Equipment Needed

Mixing bowl

Rolling pin (optional)

Pizza stone or steel

Pizza peel or flat baking sheet

Parchment paper (optional)

Spatula

Instructions

Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.
2

Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.
2

Preheat your oven to 550°F (290°C) or as high as it will go (at least 475°F or 245°C). Let the stone preheat for 30 minutes.
3

Prepare a work surface by rubbing it with oil or lightly dusting with flour.
3

Roll out the dough into a round shape, about 12 inches across.
3

Transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper, if using. Drizzle about a tablespoon of olive oil over the top of your dough and rub it all over the top, especially the edges of the crust.
3

Par bake the dough on the pizza stone for 1-2 minutes, until slightly puffed.
3

Top the pizza with 1 cup of pizza sauce, 3 ounces of thinly sliced mozzarella, 5 ounces of shredded mozzarella, and 2.5 ounces of pepperoni. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of shredded parmesan cheese.
3

Bake the pizza for about 8-12 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
3

Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes before slicing into 8 pieces and serving.

Safety Notes

Ensure the oven is preheated to the correct temperature to avoid undercooked or overcooked pizza.

Be cautious when handling hot surfaces and ingredients.

Substitutions

Use gluten-free flour for a gluten-free crust.

Substitute pepperoni with other toppings like olives, mushrooms, or sausage.

Storage

Store leftover pizza in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Freeze cooked pizza for up to 2 months.

Pro Tips

Let the dough rise overnight for a more flavorful crust.

Use a pizza peel to easily transfer the pizza to the oven.

Preheat the pizza stone for at least 30 minutes to ensure a crispy crust.

This recipe provides a quick and easy way to make pizza at home, with a focus on achieving a crispy crust and perfectly cooked toppings.
